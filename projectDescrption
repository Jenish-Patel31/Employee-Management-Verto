2. Provide a form to add a new employee.

3. Include buttons to "Edit" and "Delete" each employee in the list.

4. Editing can be done via a modal or a separate page.

Completion: All CRUD operations work seamlessly from the user interface.

Bonus Features

Add a search/filter bar on the frontend to find employees by name.
